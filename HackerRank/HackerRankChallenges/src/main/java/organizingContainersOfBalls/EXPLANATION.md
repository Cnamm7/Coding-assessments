# Challenge Explanation:

David faces the challenge of sorting his collection of balls, which are distributed across multiple containers. Each container represents a different type of ball. To achieve his goal, David plans to use a sorting method that involves swapping balls between containers. His objective is to arrange the balls so that each container holds only one type of ball, and no two balls of the same type are in separate containers.

challenge name: Organizing Containers Of Balls

# Solution Explanation:


After analyzing the question, I've deduced that each container contains a specific number of balls, with each type having a set quantity. By strategically swapping the balls between containers, it's possible to create a configuration where each container accommodates one ball type. The key lies in finding a container with enough capacity to house all the balls of a given type. By iterating through the containers, we can determine if such a configuration is feasible. If we identify containers with sufficient space to accommodate all types of balls, then achieving the desired sorting outcome is possible through a series of swaps.
