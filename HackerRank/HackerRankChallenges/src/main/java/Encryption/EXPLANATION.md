# Challenge Explanation:


An English text is to be encrypted using the following encryption scheme. Initially, the spaces are removed from the text. The characters are then arranged in a grid of size rows by columns, where the product of rows and columns should not be less than the length of the text. Additionally, both the number of rows and columns are equal to the square root of the original text length. Each column of the grid represents a new word, thus encrypting the original text.
